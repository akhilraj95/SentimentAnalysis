Well obviously there are certain limitation that you have to live with.
1. Cant download music from other shared Link: this is overdone by the quality of music available on IPhone and there are other means of sharing the music onto the phone
2. Truecaller does not work like the Android version
3. Dail pad does not allows to search contact by typing there initials - This was definitely a pain points initially but once you get use to fast speed of looking up faster in contact list this is not much of an Hurdle
Itâ€™s an expensive phone. Unlike many Android players, Apple has been able to stick to its premium price points for devices. And I mean premium.
You always need a case since the phone is slippery in hand.Only thing I felt missing is optical image stabilisation and some add on gesture.
Camera also sometimes gives problem.Flash does not work properly.For this also you have to restart your iphone.
1.less battery back up(I mean not less but for the given 3300 mah the stand by time is somewhat low {2nd update definitely improved the battery optimizations but I feel its not that great improvization} )
2.Single external speaker(Only if you want a loud one)
3.No NFC (It not at all bothers me)
4.No Quick Charging ( Feared about this before getting the device on hands but after the recent update the phone charges under 1hr 40min approx but it does takes its time to charge when we use it while charging . So keep the phone idle to get a decent fast charging)
